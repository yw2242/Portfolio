            <h2 id="pro-h2">HELLO!</h2>
            <p id="pro-p">My name is Megan and I recently graduated with a Master's degree in information science from Cornell University where my study was focused on HCI, UI/UX design and product development.<br>
                As a student, I had the privilege to work with our industry partner, Assurant, to create UI elements using Sketch and to develop code snippets for their digital design system leveraged by developers.
                On top of school projects, I also worked on multiple product development side projects that demonstrate my ability to succeed as an UI/UX and Product Designer.
                Additionally, my past internships served as a strong foundation for my professionalism and showed my aptitude to adapt to a wide variety of workplace environments.
            </p>

        </div>

        <div class="row">   
            <p>Skill-wise, I am proficient in Sketch, Figma, HTML, CSS to name a few, as well as various UI/UX design/prototyping tools and concepts.
            I will thrive well in a dynamic, fast-paced and challenging work environment. I am also a fast learner, problem solver and promise keeper whom the fellow coworkers can count on getting tasks done efficiently.<br>
            I invite you to take a look at my profile and see if there is a space for me to shine!</p>
